## Overview
Email Archiver is a Python script that connects to an IMAP email server, retrieves emails, and stores them locally in a structured format. The script decodes email content, handles attachments, and ensures safe filenames for storage.

## Features
- Connects to an IMAP server
- Retrieves and processes emails
- Decodes text and HTML content
- Handles attachments
- Stores emails in a structured format
- Configurable via a YAML file

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - `PyYAML`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `unidecode`

## Installation

### 1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-archiver.git
   cd email-archiver
   ```  

### 2.  Create a virtual environment:
```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4.  Configure the script:
â€¢   Edit the config.yaml file with your IMAP server details and archive directory.

## Configuration

The script uses a config.yaml file to store configuration details:

```yaml
imap_server: "imap.example.com"
username: "your-email@example.com"
password: "your-email-password"
output_folder: "/path/to/archive"
```

## Usage

Run the script using:
```sh
python Email_Archiver.py
```

## Scheduling with launchd on macOS

To run this script every hour on macOS, you can use launchd. Follow these steps:
### 1. Create a plist file:
â€¢ Open Terminal and create a new file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/:

```sh
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.email.archiver.plist
```
### 2.  Add the following content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.email.archiver</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python</string>
            <string>/path/to/email-archiver/Email_Archiver.py</string>
        </array>
        <key>StartInterval</key>
        <integer>3600</integer> <!-- Runs every hour -->
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
        <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
        <string>/path/to/email-archiver</string>
        <key>StandardOutPath</key>
        <string>/tmp/email_archiver.out</string>
        <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
        <string>/tmp/email_archiver.err</string>
    </dict>
</plist>
```

Note:
    â€¢   Replace /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python with the absolute path to the Python interpreter in your virtual environment. For example, /Users/yourusername/email-archiver/env/bin/python.
    â€¢   Replace /path/to/email-archiver/Email_Archiver.py with the absolute path to the Email_Archiver.py script.
    â€¢   Ensure all paths are absolute to prevent issues with launchd.

### 3.  Load the job:
```sh
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.email.archiver.plist
```

To unload the job:
```sh
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.email.archiver.plist
```

Important Considerations:
    â€¢   **Absolute Paths:** Ensure all paths in the .plist file are absolute. Relative paths can cause the job to fail.
    â€¢   **Permissions:** Ensure your script and the Python interpreter have the necessary execute permissions. You can set the appropriate permissions using the chmod command:
```sh
chmod +x /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python
chmod +x /path/to/email-archiver/Email_Archiver.py
```

â€¢   **Environment Variables:** If your script relies on specific environment variables, you can define them within the .plist file using the <key>EnvironmentVariables</key> directive.

By following these steps, your Python script will run automatically every hour using launchd on macOS.
